# Projeto-Compiladores
## Compilers Course Project, 3rd year of the BSc in Informatics Engineering, 2021

This repository contains a compiler for the DEIGo programming language, a subset of Go.
The lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis, as well as intermediate code generation, are implemented here.

The code is written in C, using a framework comprised of Lex and Yacc.
Some relevant data structures, such as dynamic-sized vectors and hash tables, are implemented and used for realism.

The compiler was tested using the Mooshak judge available.
